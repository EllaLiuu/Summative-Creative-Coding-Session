# Summative Creative Coding Session - Mad Libs Generator
This repository contains the progress I have made on the Mad Libs Generator coding challenge as well as the progress made on 2 of my peer's submissions.

My creative coding session was based off Professor Dan Shiffman's [Coding Challenge #39: Mad Libs Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziBO-U2_t3k&t=855s)

# Classmates' Creative Coding Sessions - Timer and Perlin Noise Terrain
My classmate's coding session was based off Professor Dan Shiffman's [Coding Challenge #66: JavaScript Countdown Timer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLtAMg9_Svw)

**What I did to refactor the program:**
* Added an input and button which asked for user input as to indicate how long the timer would go on for 
* Added a text saying "Times Up!" when the timer reached 0

My classmate's coding session was based off Professor Dan Shiffman's [Coding Challenge #11: 3D Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise in Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB1hWWedMk)

**What I did to refactor the program:**
* Changed the fill color and background to make it look more like real mountains instead of drawing it as a mesh
* Changed the rotation amount to make it seem like we are flying into the mountains rather than over them
* Changed the speed at which we were "flying" to make it go faster
