# Summative-Creative-Coding-Session
This repository contains the progress I have made on the Mad Libs Generator coding challenge as well as the progress made on 2 of my peer's submissions.

My creative coding session was based off Professor Dan Shiffman's [Coding Challenge #39: Mad Libs Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziBO-U2_t3k&t=855s)
